                About the MFAH
                Established in 1900, the MFAH is the largest cultural institution in the southwest region. The Museum’s
                main campus is located in the heart of Houston’s Museum District, and comprises the Audrey Jones Beck
                Building, the Caroline Wiess Law Building, the Glassell School of Art, and the Lillie and Hugh Roy
                Cullen Sculpture Garden. Nearby, two remarkable house museums—Bayou Bend Collection and Gardens, and
                Rienzi—present collections of American and European decorative arts. Resources that can be found
                throughout the MFAH include a repertory cinema, two significant research libraries, public archives,
                and a conservation and storage facility. The encyclopedic collections of the MFAH cover world cultures
                dating from antiquity to the present and include in-depth holdings of American art, European paintings,
                pre-Columbian and African gold, decorative arts and design, photography, prints and drawings, Modern
                and Contemporary painting and sculpture, and Latin American art. The MFAH is also home to the
                International Center for the Arts of the Americas (ICAA), a leading research institute for 20th-century
                Latin American and Latino art.
